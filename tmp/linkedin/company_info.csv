Welcome to Carnival Australia - home of the world’s leading cruise lines. 

Our seven iconic cruise brands - Carnival Cruise Line, Cunard Line, Holland America Line, P&O Cruises, P&O Cruises World Cruising, Princess Cruises and Seabourn - are at the helm of record industry growth. We have successfully made cruising the fastest growing sector of Australian and New Zealand tourism; and made our region the fastest growing cruise market in the world. It’s safe to say, we put cruising on the map. And the future has never looked brighter.

In June 2017, P&O Cruises welcomed its newest ship, Pacific Explorer. Decked out with a brand new waterpark and two waterslides, Pacific Explorer is an exciting addition to the P&O fleet (or should we say family). P&O’s sister line, Princess Cruises, entered the market in 2002 and has since grown to five year-round home ported ships, and has garnered a loyal following of guests. Known as the resident ‘fun ships’, Carnival Cruise Line launched Carnival Spirit in 2012, Carnival Legend in 2014, and, after realising the growth potential in the Australian market, recently announced Carnival Splendour will be joining her sister ships in 2019.

We have an impressive team of 400 people shore side, who think big, stand tall and play to win. Our positive company culture is felt throughout our many divisions, from marketing, sales and pricing, through to corporate affairs, finance and IT. Our modern, open plan head office in Chatswood is designed to promote inclusivity, team work and transparent leadership.

PaidRight can operate from 100 - 500,000+ employees, so businesses see the whole picture, not just part of it. Every shift, every employee, every legal agreement. 

Through PaidRight’s custom pay models, businesses are now able to assess their overall employee pay compliance position by analysing their payroll data, against their own interpretation of the relevant award(s) or enterprise agreement(s). 

PaidRight was initially established as a collaborative venture between PwC Australia and Data 61 (CSIRO) to help solve the uncertainty around payroll compliance caused by the complex industrial relations landscape, the challenges with setting up and maintaining multiple payroll systems and dealing with thousands of employees. 

Businesses now have the ability to identify the root cause of employee pay variance, giving them the tools to be able to prove and improve their payroll compliance.

Across the industry, technology teams were seen as failing to deliver business value and agility. We believed talented technologists focusing on delivering business initiatives were key to delivering lasting competitive advantage for our customers. Today we have over 800 team members following this vision across our offices in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart, Perth, Bengaluru, and New Zealand.

We are a consultant led organisation and by hiring the best talent in the market, we provide the best to our customers. Our consultants are selected against carefully set criteria to ensure strong communication skills and the ability to solve challenging, multi-dimensional problems. As a result, we have developed a first rate team focused on delivering business value.

We drive competitive advantage for our customers by enabling them to become data driven. We work collaboratively with clients to leverage their data assets and deliver innovative solutions that drive business value and growth through our five core pillars of Data & Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, Digital, Customer Engagement and Cloud & Technology.

We deliver this value through three service lines:

- Advisory to set out the strategy and direction,
- Consulting to deliver the vision and;
- Managed Services to ensure ongoing operational excellence.

Altis was founded in 1998 by Hyun Choi and Gavin Cooke, with a vision to grow a living company that would continue to be prosperous in the face of whatever the future held. They were not building a business to sell, rather they were fostering a culture that could grow with the modern world.

And as Altis did grow, its core ethos developed out of this family foundation. ‘Connecting with Courage, Heart, and Insight’ became the central framework for how Altis operated. In simple terms, it meant a commitment to our team, our clients and our community. Our drive came from building lasting relationships, sharing responsibility and reaching goals together. Even as we’ve continued to expand into Data and Analytics, we’ve held onto this ethos, always putting people first, business second.

At Altis, what we provide is ongoing; a permanent seat at the table with equal share in every conversation. We will connect you to thought leaders in the industry, who will provide their insights into your problems. Altis nurtures lifelong learning in all of our team members because we know that a happy, engaged team means happy, loyal customers, which spells success for both of us. This is the belief that Altis was founded on, the way that we work now, and the way we will continue to work in the years to come.

Over the last 20 years, Altis has delivered a variety of projects ranging from Strategies to Delivery to Managed Services for clients in Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Auckland and London.

We aim to give back to the Social Innovation Space and we provide a clear and transparent service to both client and candidate. 

WHAT? 

We build teams of digital specialists, who ensure that clients are able to create the latest and most innovative products, technology or services or we help them to achieve digital transformation within their organisation.

We work across the UX, Creative, Service Design, Product, Production, Analytics, Big Data, Web Development, Mobile, Marketing & Social Media Space. 

We won’t just judge our candidates on their CV / portfolio alone. Instead we invest in thought-leadership events and intelligent targeting to identify game-changing candidates by their individuality and raw talent. We find talent that transform companies, many of them change the world, and that's pretty cool. That’s why we love what we do. 

WHERE? 

Our core client and candidate base revolves around Sydney and Melbourne, but we’re always open to a new challenge and in the past have worked across many other places in Australia and in Europe.

We now employ over 4,200 talented staff across 32 countries. Businesses world-wide rely on us to find the very best specialist professionals to drive their business forward. Why? Because those same professionals trust us to manage their long-term careers. 

We're proud to be a world-leading recruitment consultancy with one million followers on LinkedIn. We also have a successful recruitment outsourcing business called Resource Solutions and a clerical recruitment brand operating in Europe called Walters People.

Our philosophy:


We don't aim to be the biggest recruitment consultancy but we do aim to be the best. We help businesses build  powerful teams that deliver against exceptionally high standards by holding ourselves up to those same values. Quality and integrity are our watchwords and we like to think we're different. Here's a flavour of why:

• We have specialist recruitment teams who are experts in their area. Whether they're recruiting in accountancy, HR or legal, you won't find them working outside their area of expertise
• Our consultants don't work on commission, but instead rely on team work to ensure the right person is placed in the right job
• We will never send out your CV without express permission. Quite simply, we don't think it's right

We're proud of what we've achieved so far. But we don't look back, we're always innovating:

Student growth matters because it enables every student to progress regardless of starting point or capabilities.

We support student growth in subject learning and mastery; in confidence and commitment to learning; in engagement and enthusiasm for learning. We do this by working directly with students and their families to augment a student’s traditional, formal education – building on what they learn at school, supporting their academic development and performance in a way that meets their personal needs and circumstances.

Cluey is not a tutoring company or a marketplace. We don't just provide platforms, tools, content, or tutors. In order to improve student learning and growth we integrate and focus learning content, tools, support and feedback to target and adapt to student needs and performance over time. We don't think students might improve if they use Cluey, we know that they do.

Every hour of learning with Cluey generates ~100,000 data points that we map back to both what and how students are learning. No-one has been able to do this before. And this is just one of the things we do.

We're still in the early stages of this journey. We started Cluey in 2017 and launched the first version of our online tutorial model for individual students in 2018 (first for Mathematics, then for English and Chemistry). In 2019 we introduced small group learning for Mathematics and English and started running small pilot programs to support in-school learning. We listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX: CLU) in December 2020 to accelerate our growth and expansion.

The work we do at Cluey is both interesting and rewarding.

As the global leader in implantable hearing solutions, at Cochlear (ASX: COH) we are committed to our mission to help people hear and be heard. Our story started more than four decades ago when Professor Graeme Clark pioneered the world's first multi-channel cochlear implant and created an entirely new treatment for hearing loss.  

Since our formation in 1981, we continue Professor Clark’s work to help people with moderate to profound hearing loss experience a life full of hearing. 

We have provided more than 650,000 implantable devices. Each recipient helps form a global community of millions, through families, friends, colleagues, teachers and more. And they’re not just connected to their own community — each shares a link with each other and to Professor Clark’s childhood desire to help people hear. 

We aim to give people the best lifelong hearing experience and access to innovative future technologies. We understand the privilege of connecting people to a life lived with hearing. And we listen, respond and move with the times – to continue to bring hearing within reach of all those who need it.

Toyota is a recognised brand in Australia, so you probably know something about us already. Maybe you or someone you know drives a Toyota or Lexus? What you might not know is that we are Australia’s largest automotive financier or that we were the first finance company Toyota established out of Japan back in 1982.

In Australia there are two separate Toyota businesses; Toyota Motor Corporation Australia (TMCA) in Melbourne, and Toyota Finance Australia (TFA) with headquarters in Sydney. While we work closely together, TMCA focuses on vehicles and here at Toyota Finance Australia our priority is to provide finance, insurance and fleet management services.

Our national presence is one of the reasons why we are successful in Australia. Most Australians, including those working in the outback and far north of the country, have access to TFA through our regional offices and local Toyota dealers. With over 30 years' experience in the Australian market, an extensive network of regional offices and as a leader within the worldwide Toyota Financial Services group, we pride ourselves in listening to and understanding our customers.

Alongside our Retail, Finance & Insurance and Toyota Fleet Management streams, there are opportunities in our organisation across all functions you would expect in a large company from Human Resources to Information Technology, Corporate Services, Marketing, Risk and Legal, Audit & Compliance, and our National Customer Solutions Centre – that responds to 400,000 customer phone calls each year and aims to deliver a positive experience for each one.

• We have specialist recruitment teams who are experts in their area. Whether they're recruiting in accountancy, HR or legal, you won't find them working outside their area of expertise
• Our consultants don't work on commission, but instead rely on team work to ensure the right person is placed in the right job
• We will never send out your CV without express permission. Quite simply, we don't think it's right

We're proud of what we've achieved so far. But we don't look back, we're always innovating:

For over 20 years we’ve been supporting our customers through providing engineering know-how.

Our customers range from large multi-national companies, through to top tiered systems integrators and our strength is in taking on difficult non-standard requirements, whilst being conscious of cost, effectiveness and performance.

Our growth is focused around our engineering solutions approach. We have extensive applications know-how from complex RFID requirements through to developing autonomous vehicle systems in agriculture. We will design and implement a system solution that provides the best value for our customers.

From humble beginnings in 1932, we’ve grown to become the nation’s largest not-for-profit health fund, helping to protect the health and wellbeing of over 1.8 million Australians with health, life, travel or pet insurance. And we remain constant to our not-for-profit charter, continuing to provide the highest standard of healthcare while returning more benefits to our members. 

We’re also proud of our many industry firsts. Over the years, we’ve been at the forefront of healthcare innovation, from introducing the first multicover plan to “cover the gap” in extras services, to opening one of the first health fund operated dental centre networks and launching Australia’s first on-demand injury cover*. 

Because we believe in making healthcare understandable, affordable and high quality for our members, they’re empowered to make informed decisions about their health.  

Through the HCF Catalyst program, we continue to invest in the future of Australia’s health by supporting small businesses with big ideas, and fund researchers working to improve health outcomes for all Aussies through the HCF Research Foundation.  

We’re also committed to investing in the health and wellbeing of our staff. At HCF, we value diversity, inclusion and equality in the workplace, and are dedicated to creating a working culture where staff can flourish.

BELLA'S SANCTUARY
Bella’s Sanctuary is a 5 unit, purpose-built save haven for women and children to reside in for up to 12 months, after they have left a shelter, to give them time to rebuild their lives. It was 100% funded by the corporate community who wanted to do their part to change the future of those who have escaped DV.

The residence was created because of a lack of affordable housing, as well as a void of medium-term accommodation for survivors to live in after leaving a shelter. This gap was reinforcing the belief in survivors that there are only two housing options for those leaving a shelter and they are either returning to the abuser or homelessness.",51-200,https://www.dvconnect.org,"['Domestic Violence Helpline', 'Sexual Assault Helpline', 'Pets In Crisis Program', 'Crisis counselling', 'Safety Planning', 'Domestic Violence Policies', 'Domestic Violence training', 'Sexual Assault Help', 'Domestic Violence Help', 'Domestic family violence help', 'Help for pets', 'Domestic violence education']",Nonprofit Organization Management,[],

Built by Obsession: How Doing it Better Became Our MissionOur founder and father Sam Abdelmalak wasn’t always a builder. He found his life’s passion by chance. After working as an engineer for almost 30 years, he built a fine new home for his young family, perfect in every detail. It was, in his own words ‘a masterpiece’. Then in 1995 Sam lost his job during the recession and couldn’t find work, and desperate to put food on the table he sold the beloved home to finance a new business – home construction.Perhaps because of what was at stake, perhaps because of his obsessive nature, the townhouses he built set a standard for quality in the residential property market. In 1997 Sam’s eldest son Simon joined the business, and they began building on his early success. The focus expanded from townhouses to multiple homes on larger sites as Sam’s second and third sons Daniel and Joshua joined the team.Sam and his sons were never happy with the status quo in the industry, and decided the only way to ensure that their off-the-plan apartments were unique and remained true to our heritage, was to do everything in-house.Today Samma Property Group is a respected developer in the medium density and high-rise residential market, selling one, two and three bedroom apartments across inner Melbourne.We’re known for our attention to detail, and our customer focus.

At Talent we see community impact and legacy as vital to our business, which is why we tackle social bias and attitudes. We do this through our charity Talent RISE which provides employment opportunities for young people experiencing barriers to employment, and programs like 100% Human at Work promoting the importance of diversity, equality and respect in the workplace. Talent is also an active member of Virgin Unite’s B Team with a particular focus on the challenges and opportunities associated with the Future of Work.

We look to lead the way so we’re delighted to have our efforts acknowledged with 27 awards globally in the last few years from the likes of LinkedIn, EY, Deloitte, and Gallup who recognised Talent as one of the Top 40 companies in the world to work based on employee engagement.

PaidRight can operate from 100 - 500,000+ employees, so businesses see the whole picture, not just part of it. Every shift, every employee, every legal agreement. 

Through PaidRight’s custom pay models, businesses are now able to assess their overall employee pay compliance position by analysing their payroll data, against their own interpretation of the relevant award(s) or enterprise agreement(s). 

PaidRight was initially established as a collaborative venture between PwC Australia and Data 61 (CSIRO) to help solve the uncertainty around payroll compliance caused by the complex industrial relations landscape, the challenges with setting up and maintaining multiple payroll systems and dealing with thousands of employees. 

Businesses now have the ability to identify the root cause of employee pay variance, giving them the tools to be able to prove and improve their payroll compliance.
